V.02 INCOMPLETE!

This is the first release, I have attempted to be as thorough as possible, however it is quite possible, if not likely, there are undiscovered functions.

Please report any strange behavior/discovered functions/editing methods on the /r/subrosanrc subreddit or by making an issue on github!

Until a more permanent solution is found, you may use this Sub for loose,incoomplete, and rough modded file posts if you like. 

Feel free to contact me /u/Defaultplayer001 or Star-LoRed on Steam directly with any questions!

#**rosedit**

Welcome to the rosedit readme.txt! These are unofficial patched Sub Rosa executables that enable a built in editing mode. Nearly all copies of Sub Rosa already have editing mode embedded inside them, they just havent been enabled.

On behalf of all [srs] ,I hope you enjoy!

#**Credits**

/u/hontro for finding editing mode and patching the executables.
Star-LoRED (/u/Defaultplayer001) for writing an in-depth documentation for editing mode.
#**Supported versions**

0.25
####**Important Note**

The download link is hosted separatley from GitHub for security reasons. The modified executables are the sole property of Cryptic Sea, and are to be used for educational purposes only. We are not responsible and do not condone any malicious activity attempted with these modified executables.

#**Installation**

Simply place each executable in your Sub Rosa root directory.

It should be in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sub Rosa

#**Download**

(to be linked)

Note on custom textures: The editor will load any textures of the right file type/size located in the /data/textures directory. So fully custom textures ARE possible. However, it is not as simple as click to add, it's really finicky, but there is a method. I will research more and post a reliable method.
